<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Now we will start predicting the next symbol of the user input. You will be surprised how often people repeat the same patterns!</p>

<p>Imagine the following: after the second stage for a string <code class="java">0101010100101001010101000111101010010101010010101010101</code> we have calculated the amount of a certain character (0 or 1) that follows a specific triad of numbers:  <code class="java">'000': [0, 1], '001': [4, 1], '010': [5, 16], '011': [0, 1], '100': [1, 4], '101': [16, 0], '110': [0, 1], '111': [1, 1]</code>. Now, the user enters the sequence <code class="java">001110</code>. How can we foresee the next numbers?</p>

<p>Starting with the 4th character, we can predict the input based on the triads obtained in the previous stage. We've learned that the combination "001" (the first three characters) was followed by a "0" in 4 cases out of 5. So, the estimated probability that the user will enter "0" as the fourth character is 4/5 = 80%. For "1" probability is 1/5 = 20%. Therefore, we predict "0'" as the fourth character. Unfortunately, we didn't guess but let's go further. In the same way, the 5th character is more likely to be "1" relying on statistics for the triad preceding it ("011"). This time we are right. In this stage, you're invited to write a program, which will sequentially scan three characters of the user's sequence at a time and make a prediction of what goes next.</p>

<p>And what about the first three characters? Generate a sequence of three binary numbers, and that's it. Based on this triple, make predictions for further symbols. </p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take and preprocess user input as described in stage 1.</li>
	<li>Calculate user statistics using triads as described in stage 2 (but don't output the statistics this time).</li>
	<li>Ask the user to enter another test string of 0's and 1's, which we will try to predict, and preprocess the new input.</li>
	<li>Going through the string entered by the user, estimate the frequency of occurrence of "0" or "1" after each triad and generate predictions: if the count of 0's after the current triad is higher, the program should predict "0", otherwise, predict "1". If the counts are equal, the choice can be made in a random way.</li>
	<li>The first three symbols may be predicted by chance one by one using the <code class="java">random</code> module. You can also invent your own algorithm here, for instance, make use of the overall frequencies of 0's and 1's in the user input. In the output, print your prediction right after the user's test string.</li>
	<li>Test the accuracy of our predictor (excluding the first 3 randomly predicted symbols) by comparing the real input and the prediction. As the final output, print the line <code class="java">Computer guessed right N out of M symbols (ACC%)</code>, where <code class="java">N</code> is the number of correctly guessed symbols, <code class="java">M</code> is the total length of the test input, and <code class="java">ACC</code> is the accuracy value with 0.01% precision. Remember to exclude the first 3 symbols from the calculation!</li>
</ol>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
