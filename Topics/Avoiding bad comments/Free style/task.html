  <p>In the code field, you can see a piece of a program. You don't have to know all the tools that are used in this code (you will if you continue studying Python)! For now, we provide an explanation of what it does:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Import the module <code class="java">os</code> that provides tools to work with the operating system of your computer.</li> 
   <li>Ask a user for the input file name.</li> 
   <li>If the path that a user has entered exists, do the following steps: 
    <ol> 
     <li>Open the file in the reading mode, read its content, and close the file.</li> 
     <li>Apply the previously defined function <code class="java">preprocess()</code> to the text taken from the file.</li> 
     <li>Open for writing new file with a slightly changed name, write the preprocessed text there, and close the file.</li> 
     <li>Print that everything is done.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>If the path entered by a user doesn't exist, print the corresponding message.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Your task is to put the comments in the code where you think they are appropriate. Don't change anything in the code, just add the comments. And mind the rules of good commenting!</p>
